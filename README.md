# Frackin Universe Web Directory

I'll add a proper readme...one day? Maybe never, I can't imagine anyone will look at this.

This is a super rough Next.js / TypeScript project to replicate the Frackin Universe Lab Directory. Only it doesn't need to be near your machines, and (criticaly) provides output item counts and precise probabilities.

This was built in under a day as a personal little hackathon so the code is suuuper rough, poorly optimized and terribly organized. Browse at your own risk.

Probabilities and icons taken directly from the frackin universe source code.
